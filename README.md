# Eberron Cosmology Model

A 3D visualization of the Eberron Cosmology, written in Javascript using React and Three.js

## Concept

Eberron has a total of 13 moons orbitting it, as well as 13 planes of existence that shift between coterminance and being "remote" from it (one could visualize it as an orbit as well). Wizards of the Coast has a wonderful [calendar](http://marksworld.zeemer.com/files/calendar/calendar.html) that has been around since 2004, but I thought I'd give a go at making it using modern technologies and frameworks.
